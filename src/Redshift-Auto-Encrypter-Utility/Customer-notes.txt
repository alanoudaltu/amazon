Customer Notes :
================

1. Customer must have a source unencrypted cluster and destination Encrypted cluser with higher or same configuration.
2.Customer can only migrate one database at a time 
3.Customer must create a s3 bucket which will be used to unload and copy cluster data.
4.Please note that passwords cannot be migrated  and hence must be reset once migration is completed.
5.Please follow instructions displayed.
6.Please enter proper details when prompted for or it may break migration
7.Please provide an s3 bucket for unload and copy , s3 bucket should be in same region as source.
8. make sure your cli is configured .
9. make sure you have installed python 3+ and boto3 installed.


Limitations:
=============
1.Use new cluster as a destination cluster is recommended to avoid namespace clashes which may result in migration failure.


Notes:
======
1. Master user from source will not be copied to destination as destination will have its own master user.
2. We will be creating and deleting a role for this process which will have s3 access , so please do not modify the role while the process is running.
3.Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) log settings are not migrated, so be sure to enable database audit logging on the new cluster.
Historic information that is stored in STL and SVL tables is not migrated to or retained in the new cluster

ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WE CANNOT CREATE DUPLICATE USERS AND GROUPS , IF THE CODE FALTERS BECUASE OF ONE OR THE OTHER REASONS, YOU CAN RUN IT THE SECOND TIME AND IF YOU GET 'USER EXISTS OR GROUP EXISTS WITH THE SAME NAME'  ERROR COMMENT BELOW LINES OF CODE
